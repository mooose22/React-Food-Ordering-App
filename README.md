# React-Food-Ordering-App
A full stack web application which allows users to order meals. The users can browse the menu, add/remove meals to their cart, and watch as the total price updates in real-time. Once they're ready to order, they can securely provide their information and submit their order. The order then gets sent to the backend servers.
